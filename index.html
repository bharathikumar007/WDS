                                        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">The Design Process</span> Within the design process, seven steps can be identified: define, research, ideate, prototype, select, implement and learn.Design is a process that turns a brief or requirement into a finished product or design solution. The design process can be said to comprise seven stages: define, research, ideate, prototype, select, implement and learn.
                                        </p>

                                        First, the design problem and the target audience needs to be <span class="font-weight-bold"> defined</span>. A precise understanding of the problem and its constraints allows more exact solutions to be developed. This stage determines what is necessary for the project to be successful. The <span class="font-weight-bold"> research</span> stage reviews information such as the history of the design problem, end-user research and opinion-led interviews, and identifies potential obstacles.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <span class="font-weight-bold">Ideate</span> is the stage where end-user motivations and needs are identified and ideas are generated to meet these, perhaps through brainstorming.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <span class="font-weight-bold">Prototyping</span> sees the resolve or working-up of these ideas, which are presented for user-group and stakeholder review, prior to being presented to the client.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <span class="font-weight-bold">Selection</span> sees the proposed solutions reviewed against the design brief objective. Some solutions might be practical but may not be the best ones.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <span class="font-weight-bold">Implementation</span> sees design development and its final delivery to the client.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <span class="font-weight-bold">Learning</span> helps designers improve their performance and, for this reason, designers should seek client and target audience feedback and determine if the solution met the goals of the brief. This may identify improvements that can be made in the future.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While the design process is often linear, as shown below, it frequently involves revisiting earlier segments for reworking as it evolves.

Most washing machine leaks originate with a ruptured cold or hot water supply hose. Typically made of black rubber or polymer, these hoses become failure-prone over time.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Toilet leaks can come from the water supply or tank, but the most damaging leaks occur at the flange and wax ring. When pipes running behind walls burst or begin to leak, they moisten the drywall. This moisture makes its way through the walls and produces wet spots.Sewer blockages typically occur after a big storm and reflux raw sewage into your house or basement. Be sure to schedule annual maintenance and inspect its condition to prevent future issues.
                                    </p>

                                        If your refrigerator has an automatic water dispenser or ice maker, there is always a chance for a leak or rupture. Dishwasher supply lines may also leak unnoticed behind the unit for a long time, damaging flooring.It is challenging to detect leaks in these areas because they are often buried in a wall surrounded by tiles. Any holes in the water supply lines or worn-out caulking can cause serious water damage.Not all water damage sources are located inside your home in Miami. Any gutters containing significant amounts of leaves, dirt, and other debris can cause water to flow over the side and seep into the foundation.

                                        The central air conditioner condensate pans overflow if the drain line clogs. While moisture around this appliance is common, it’s important to note that moisture on the drywall and excessive dripping can lead to water damage.For water to be supplied efficiently there is pressure needed to pump it. The issue occurs when the pressure exceeds its maximum water pressure of 40 to 60 p.s.i. If your water pressure is too high, it will stress your pipes, appliances, and fixtures. This can cause minor pinhole ruptures that lead to major ruptures, flooding your home.

As your water company, we have a responsibility to protect that water supply for everyone. Part of that involves finding and fixing leaks all over our region to make sure nothing is wasted, and we go to great lengths to make sure we're doing all we can to reduce and stop leakage. In 2019, the Environment Agency warned that England could face water shortages within 25 years as a result of climate change and a rising population. This makes the work we do to increase our water efficiency all the more important.</p>

                                        There are a couple of easy tests you can do to check for leaks before you get the professionals in. To make sure the tests are accurate, you’ll need to run them when you’re not going to use water for at least three hours. So overnight or when you’re out at work is often a good time to do it. If you’re on a water meter and you’ve recently received a bill that’s higher than you would normally expect, it could be an indication of a leak on one of your pipes.

As the ideate stage progresses, it will become clear whether there are any misunderstandings or shortcomings in the definition stage and whether sufficient levels of research were carried out. Feedback can be sought throughout the design process to clarify points of doubt with the client and to address aspects that were ill-defined during the definition stage.</p>

However, initial cost, accessibility, public nuisance, or other circumstances, may dictate that such a solution is prohibitive. In such cases, other methods of water control must be explored. When solving a water leakage problem around a building foundation or civil structure (tunnels, tanks, vaults, pipes, bridges and docks), approaches can be applied either to the exterior (positive side) or the interior (negative side). Positive side solutions are in direct contact with hydrostatic water, and therefore resist water penetration at the interface, while negative side solutions are not in direct contact with the source of water. It is common to use a combination of solutions, or perhaps different solutions on various parts of a structure, to control of water migration.</p>

                                         Access the tub inlet by lifting the main top or removing the cabinet. Inspect the hoses for signs of abrasion or cracking. You can also check behind your washer periodically for wet spots in the walls, or mold and mildew build-up around this area.  Monthly maintenance, including an inspection of the water heater’s anode rod and flushing sediment from the tank, can delay the need to replace a water heater. To check if this is the source of a water leak, remove the drain pipe and listen for a hissing sound. You can also look for a puddle underneath the tank.

                                        Routinely check behind the toilet for any leaks and inspect the pipes that lead from the wall to your toilet. Check if there are puddles or signs of mold and mildew. If you find a small puddle around the toilet, turn the water off and inspect the tank. Inspect the center connection of the check valve for a water leak. Examine the spots where the pipes connect to the valve and feel around for moisture or dripping water. To inspect the leak, unplug the appliance and examine behind the freezer to find any signs of water damage on the wall or mold.

                                         Search for puddles of water or low water pressure in these areas; they could be a sign of a water leak. Sometime the tiles will begin to lift, signaling damage. Check the condensate pump, refrigerant, and drain line for any water leaks. A safety overflow switch can be installed for added protection. Inspect for choked downspouts and check for leaks in the basement. Trim your trees or regularly clean your gutters to prevent this. Make sure all downspout segments are securely connected and drain water safely away from the foundation to prevent seepage. Be sure to inspect each pipe thoroughly for any drips or small holes. After turning the water on, examine if water is blasting out of the faucets or if the pipes make a loud banging sound.

                                        As a prototype aims to test particular aspects of a design solution, it must be made so that those aspects are present and can be effectively evaluated. To convey the idea of what it will look like, a prototype does not need to be made with the final materials. For example, architectural models are often made from whiteboard and aim to give a three-dimensional visualisation of a building design. However, if a particular print finish is stipulated, it may be pertinent to present this via a prototype.

                                        <p>The select stage is the point at which one of the proposed design solutions is chosen for development. The key decision criterion is fitness for purpose: does the design meet the needs and goals of the brief, and will it effectively communicate to the target audience to achieve those aims? The winning design is typically that which most closely meets the design brief, or a significant part of it. It may not be possible or desirable to meet all the requirements of a brief within a single design. For example, market segmentation increasingly calls for different marketing and design solutions for different segments. </p>

This could well be different to the designer’s preferred choice. At the end of the selection process, the client will sign off the choice, thus initiating the next stage in the design process.

Water is controlled on the interior concrete element face; however, the void remains filled with water.Â A simplistic, first attempt is to paste over a leaking crack/joint with a high viscosity, elastomeric, compound.

It can be very simple to complex. Simple water management solutions may involve cutting a slot/opening into a floor slab, adjacent to footing or wall leakage area(s), drilling relief holes into the composite wall structure, and channeling captured water to a nearby drain. Slot/opening depths and widths vary based on water flow rates and technique used.

All coatings and reactive agents require the substrate to be free of permeating water prior to installation. Thus, chemical grouting or crack/joint routing, caulking, and/or dry-packing may be first performed to alleviant active water leakage prior to coating or reactive mortar agent installation.

Low voltage (24 to 28 volts) output from the power supply across the terminals is created through the concrete element via water containing micro-voids. Current flows from cathode to anode and electrons flow from anode to cathode. EOP installations are designed to create low intensity, electric field(s) within wet concrete element(s) and adjacent soil.

                                        For intermittent supply systems, the mobile tanker method has been developed. A small main stretch (typically 100 connections and 400 to 500 meters) is isolated and fed under pressure during non-supply hours, long enough to measure leak flows and locations. Boundary valves and consumer connections are closed. The line supplying the injection point from the tanker contains a meter with a pulsehead, a pressure transducer and a data logger that records pressure and flow (FARLEY & TROW 2003; CPHEEO 2005). A direct measure of leakage, otherwise difficult to locate during short supply hours, can be obtained. The method has been used at large scales in the metropolitan cities of Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahemdabad (India) and Kathmandu (Nepal).
                                    </p>

                                       The mobile tanker method is one of the most cost-effective methods: it requires little material and manpower, and does not need installed consumer meters or district meters. Work does not need to be repeated as small stretches are isolated for testing purpose and all defects can be found and repaired within each part.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another method for intermittent supplies is the stop tap method (adapted from FARLEY 2001): boundary valves and customer's connections stop taps are closed. A special supply is arranged from the nearest water distribution station, and the water flow is directly metered through the test area. Basic leak detection equipment is then used to locate the leak points. The main problem with this method, as compared to the mobile tanker method, is the need to divert water supplies to the test area. It also wastes a lot of water, lost at the leak points during the test, and has to be repeated as only a few leaks are detected each time.

                                    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Obtaining feedback</span> Following the implementation, the client may begin to look for or receive feedback on how the product has been received by the target audience and how beneficial its effects on the target audience have been. Thus, a design firm can find out how the audience responded to the design. The feedback generated at the end of the process becomes a learning opportunity for future projects. It forms one of the sources of information for the define and research stages. Any problems with the design may have been because of inadequacies in the brief or lack of understanding of key points. Through the feedback process, designers and clients build up a shared understanding over time. This serves to facilitate the production of increasingly optimal solutions in the future.</p>

                                        Although the learn stage appears to be the last of the seven that we’ve identified, it actually occurs throughout the design process. At each stage you should take stock of where you are, where you are heading, what’s working and what’s not. The ability to learn from each stage will enhance the development of design thinking, and will help to generate radical and successful designs.

                                        Water supply is the primary element of an urban system. Due to rapid urbanization and water scarcity, maintaining a stable and safe water supply has become a challenge to many cities, whereas a large amount of water is lost from the pipes of distribution systems. Water leakage is not only a waste of water resources, but also incurs great socio-economic costs. This article presents a comprehensive review on the potential water leakage control approaches and specifically discusses the benefits of each to environmental conservation. It is concluded that water leakage could be further reduced by improving leakage detection capability through a combination of predictive modeling and monitoring instruments, optimizing pipe maintenance strategy, and developing an instant pressure regulation system. The environment could benefit from these actions because of water savings and the reduction of energy consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions.

                                       Burst/leakage detection and location methods have come a long way since the mid-1950s, and significant advances have been made in the past in both hardware-based and software-based techniques. According to the review presented here, conclusions and future work recommendations are made as follows. The hardware-based methods are still superior in terms of detection accuracy; however, they also remain much more expensive to use than the software-based methods. With regard to timely detection and location, the software-based methods are much better.

                                        Finally, developing ways of combining hardware-based methods with software-based methods effectively is the trend for future pipe burst and leakage research, that is to say, developing a compound method (e.g. using software-based methods to minimize the possible leakage area first, and then using hardware to pinpoint the location of leakage) which enables the water company personnel to react more quickly with lower cost in the case of burst/leak events. Although not exhaustive, this review could be a valuable reference resource for practitioners and researchers dealing with water loss management in distribution systems.

In order to accomplish this work, a case study was conducted in the water distribution system of a Greater City, Ankara. North pressure zone was choosen for the main study area because this zone is much more under control with respect to other zones. Preliminary studies and personal communications in the water utility have indicated that N8.1 pressure zone was leaking considerably; as a result of this fact, it was decided to conduct this study in this pressure zone.</p>

                                        There are two basic definitions in connection with the water losses; one is unaccounted-for water, the other is water leakage. Unaccounted-for water can be estimated by comparing annual water production and annual water bills concerning water consumption; unaccountedfor water can occur due to the water leaks, the utilization of fire hydrants, flushing works, main breaks, cleaning of storage tanks, inaccurate meters, and illegal use. Water leakage, generally, forms the largest percentage among all the already mentioned items. The percentage of water losses due to leakage may vary from 5% to 50% and even larger of the total supply. Water leakage can be defined as the difference between delivered water by the water utility and consumed water by the consumers. In this study, water leakage was studied.
                                    </p>

                                        Water leakage involves unnecessary expenses in pumping and water treatment costs; it should be added that costs necessary for repairing broken pipes of any size should be added to this list; of course, maintaining a system regularly at an accepteable level is prefereable to apply extensive rehabilitation programs to problematic systems (Walski et al., 2001). Leakage may also cause an excessive investment for developing new sources and/or expanding the system capacity to keep pace with increasing demands. In addition to these items, the amount of water itself, may be the most important factor concerning water leakage for cities located at geographical regions which might be affected by drought periods. Generally, cities with leaking systems get informed by the drougth earlier than cities with strong sytems.

World Health Organization (WHO) uses the term water transmission system for a network of pipes, generally in tree-like structure that is used to convey water from water treatment plants to service reservoirs, and uses the term water distribution system for a network of pipes that generally has a loop structure to supply water from the service reservoirs and balancing reservoirs to water consumers.</p>

                                            <p>A water distribution system consists of pipelines, storage facilities, pumps, and other accessories. Pipelines laid within public right of way called water mains are used to transport water within a distribution system. Large diameter water mains called primary feeders are used to connect between water treatment plants and service areas. Secondary feeders are connected between primary feeders and distributors. Distributors are water mains that are located near the water users, which also supply water to individual fire hydrants.</p>

                                                A service line is a small diameter pipe used to connect from a water main through a small tap to a water meter at user's location. There is a service valve (also known as curb stop) on the service line located near street curb to shut off water to the user's building.Storage facilities, or distribution reservoirs, provide clean drinking water storage (after required water treatment process) to ensure the system has enough water to service in fluctuating demands (service reservoirs), or to equalize the operating pressure (balancing reservoirs). They can also be temporarily used to serve fire fighting demands during a power outage.

                                                Water quality can be deteriorated by the internal corrosion of piping in distribution systems. This includes the corrosion of metal pipe surfaces and connections. The problems create health concerns, colors, taste and odor in water. Health concerns are related to releases trace metal such as lead, copper or cadmium to the water. Lead exposure can cause delays in physical and mental development in children. Long term exposure to copper may cause liver and kidney damage. High or long term exposure of cadmium may cause damage to various organs. Corrosion of iron materials causes the discoloring of the water that is shown as rust-coloured water or red water. Corrosion of zinc and iron can cause metallic taste.

                                                After water mains are put in service for a long time, there will be deteriorations in structural, water quality, and hydraulic performances. Structural deterioration may be caused by many reasons. Metal-based pipes develop internal and external corrosion, causing the pipe walls to thin or degrade. They can eventually leak or bust. Cement-based pipes are subjected to cement matrix and reinforced steel deterioration. All pipes are subjected to joint failures. Water quality deterioration includes scaling or tuberculation, sedimentation, and biofilm formation.

                                                Scaling is a formation of hard deposits on the interior wall of the pipes. This can be a by-product of the pipe corrosion that is combined with calcium in the water, which is called tuberculation. Sedimentation is when solids are settled within the pipes, usually at recesses between the scaling build-ups. When there is a change in the velocity of water flow (such as sudden use of a fire hydrant), the settled solids will be stirred up causing water to be discolored. Biofilms can be developed in highly scaled pipes where bacteria is allowed to grow as the higher the roughness of the interior wall, the harder it is for disinfectant to be effective by reaching the surface of the pipe wall. Hydraulic deterioration which affect pressures and flows can be a result of other deteriorations that obstruct the water flow.
